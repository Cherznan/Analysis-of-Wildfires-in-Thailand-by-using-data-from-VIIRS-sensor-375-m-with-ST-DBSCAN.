###  The northern region of Thailand has long been a popular tourist destination, both domestically and internationally, known for its beautiful landscapes and pleasant climate. However, the residents of this area have been facing the severe issue of smog and wildfires, which have intensified over the years. These problems significantly affect both the local way of life and the tourism economy. The causes of wildfires are multifaceted, including both natural occurrences and human activities. Addressing this environmental issue is crucial to mitigate its occurrence. Currently, various organizations are emphasizing and collaborating on solutions, utilizing advanced technology and tools to tackle the problem. One such technology is the VIIRS 375 m sensor, installed on the SUOMI satellite. This sensor collects data that can be analyzed to better understand wildfires using modern techniques.

### The objective of this research is to study, analyze, and categorize hotspots in the Mae Ping National Park area in Lamphun Province, Thailand. This is achieved by using the ST-DBSCAN technique and selecting appropriate parameters, as well as analyzing the direction of wildfire spread and assessing frequently affected areas over the past two years (2023-2024). The research demonstrates methods for analyzing wildfire hotspots and selecting suitable parameters for the ST-DBSCAN technique. It also examines the accuracy of data clustering through this method, utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to analyze burn scars. The study reports on the results of data clustering, parameter selection accuracy, and also includes an analysis of wildfire spread and risk assessment for recurrent wildfire areas in Mae Ping National Park.
